<p>As the global population ages, cases of dementia are also on the rise worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">55 millionTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;people currently have dementia, and the number is set to rise to 139 million by 2050.</p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/159442">Alzheimer’s disease</a>, the commonest form of dementia, affects around&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/aging/publications/features/Alz-Greater-Risk.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5.8 millionTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;people in the United States alone.</p>

<p>The greatest risk factors for dementia, according to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/risk-factors-and-prevention/what-can-increase-persons-risk-of-dementia" target="_blank">the Alzheimer’s Society</a>, are aging and genetics. Dementia is most common in those aged over 75, and having a close relative with dementia may&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30867271/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase a person’s riskTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;of developing the disorder.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other risk factors that we cannot control include sex — females are more at risk than males — and ethnicity. However,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.alzheimers.gov/life-with-dementia/can-i-prevent-dementia" target="_blank">lifestyle changes</a>, such as increasing physical exercise, controlling&nbsp;<a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/270644">blood pressure</a>, and keeping the brain stimulated, can decrease a person’s risk of dementia, even for those who have one or more risk factors.</p>
